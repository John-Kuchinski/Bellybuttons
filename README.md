# Bellybuttons with Javascript
## Link : 

# **Overview**

The goal of this module is to use a data set in the form of a JSON file in order to filter and build an interactive dashboard that will display information of the number of times a given individual has washed their belly button, along with providing multiple visualizations in order to show the Top 10 bacteria species present, and a bubble plot of the results of the bacteria culture samples

# **Resources**

# **Results**

Below I have used both the .js and the index.html in order to explore the interavtive dashboard at different steps of the process in order to provide snippets of examples of the bar plots, bubble plots, and the gauge plots in hopes to demostrate the ways the data can be manipulated and interpreted so that it can create a useful interface for whomever is seeking information on this subject.

# **Final Thoughts** 

While the overal function of this dashboard is working (Being the main goal of the module), I would like to return to this and update the CSS file in order to give the dash board a little more flare. I would like to change the background of this webpage to a darker theme to give the colors of the existing plots a little more "pop". I would also like to explore into giving some of the items more of a transition while loading the next test subjects. Javascript is a wonderful tool to use when trying to provide information for people and to make the information pleasing to look at.
